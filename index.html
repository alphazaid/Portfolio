                    I'm Zaid Motiwala, a computer science student currently studying at
                    the University of Texas at Dallas. I have a wide array of interests but 
                    some of my hobbies include singing, gaming, and binging kdramas on Netflix.
                    My goal is to continue improving my programming skills and apply them to 
                    the many companies (and hopefully one day my own). This is just a small 
                    showcase I put together to share my abilities with others.

                    <h1>Dutch Solitaire</h1>
                    <p>
                        This java-based desktop game was a game created by me using the java graphics interface.
                        It allows users to take a set of randomly ordered cards in a 4x13 layout where the player can 
                        only move the cards based on certain rules. Once the cards are all in order by number and suit
                        the player wins.

                    <p>
                        
                        I created this desktop application using Python and SQL to track and analyze mine as well as 
                        some others finances to help them get a better organization and handle of their money. This application
                        creates a UI created by python using the many libraries and then takes the financial information input by the 
                        user to give them a report for them to better manage their money. The financial information is stored in a database
                        made by SQL so that they can save the finances and other information input by them as well as have their own login
                        to connect to that database or create a new one.

                    <p>
                        For this project, I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a website to showcase my portfolio.
                        During this project I combined used HTML to create the site, CSS to format, and JScript to create 
                        functions that my website would perform. I optimized the website to have cross-platform compatibility so 
                        that it can work with laptop, tablets, and phones.
